We are driven by our passion for sport and it is precisely this enthusiasm that we want to pass on to our participants. Our aim is to get people, especially children and young people, excited about sport and help them to get better at the sport they love.",
                "paragraph2": "The trick is to combine hard work with passion. This is how we develop not only as athletes, but also as people and achieve things that previously seemed unthinkable. We want to combine the two to create the most holistic and effective training experience possible.",
                "paragraph3": "At a time when the digital world is increasingly influencing our lives, it is more important than ever to inspire children and young people to exercise and play sport. Today, young people are moving less than ever before. Instead of sitting in front of their cell phones for hours on end, we want to motivate them to do sport, to develop a genuine enjoyment of it and the inner will to get the best out of themselves in their discipline.",
                "paragraph4": "Our training sessions not only promote athletic development, but they also strengthen the community. Sport unites. Nelson Mandela also summed this up:",

We understand their perspective, speak their language and know how to motivate them. As we are active ourselves, we are able to demonstrate each exercise correctly and comprehensibly, which is crucial for the learning process. After all, children and young people not only learn by doing, but also visually by seeing.",
                "paragraph2": "Our training concept is based on a simple but effective principle: we always ask ourselves the following questions first:",

                "paragraph3": "Only when we can clearly answer these questions do we integrate an element into our program. Every exercise, every method is a conscious decision and has a specific application in the respective sport. We always ask ourselves whether this exercise would help us progress and make us a more complete player as well.",
                "paragraph4": "Our approach is driven by constant reflection and improvement. We believe in the principle that “change is the only constant in life”, as the Greek philosopher Heraclitus once said.",

In 2022 I started 3 Steps Hockey and been coaching actively ever since. I founded it to share my love for sports and help participants improve at it through a well-rounded and holistic approach to training."
