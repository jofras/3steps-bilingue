          <strong>3 Steps</strong> stands for wholeness. Many things are often summarized with 3 things and so 3 Steps is
          symbolic of the fact that we try to take into account all aspects that influence people and athletes and thus their
          performance in sport.
        </p>

        <p className="text-textdark text-base">
          Life is complex and is influenced by many different factors and so is sport. Just as in life, many different
          factors contribute to success or failure, so it is in sport. An athlete&apos;s performance is influenced by many different
          variables, and with 3 Steps we try to integrate all these aspects into our program.

        <p className="text-textdark text-base">
          Sport can also be roughly divided into 3 categories:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-textdark text-base space-y-1">
          <li>Sport-specific ability</li>
          <li>Physique</li>
          <li>Mind</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-textdark text-base">
          These categories can then be divided again into 3 further categories and then those categories again. This shows
          that sport is a never-ending learning and development process. You are never finished, neither as a person nor as
          an athlete.
        </p>

        <p className="text-textdark text-base">
          In the midst of this complexity, it is crucial to keep a clear head and focus on the essentials. This is exactly
          where our training comes in:
        </p>

        <p className="text-textdark text-base">
          We provide structure and take a targeted yet holistic approach. Our goal is to offer training that is both
          comprehensive and effective, focused on what really matters and is aligned with our capabilities, considering the
          scope of each training.
